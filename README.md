# CD-PSIICOS
CD-PSIICOS (Context-Dependent PSIICOS) is a novel framework for MEG/EEG functional connectivity estimation that suppresses spatial leakage while preserving zero-phase coupling, leveraging task-specific cortical power distributions. 

This repository is currently being finalized. Core functionality and demos will be uploaded shortly. The full documentation and examples are on the way.
